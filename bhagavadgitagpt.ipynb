Meditation helps to calm the mind and body, allowing one to become more aware of their thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness helps to bring awareness to the present moment, allowing one to observe their thoughts and feelings without judgment or attachment. Practicing these techniques can help to reduce anger and cultivate a more peaceful and balanced state of mind. Additionally, engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation, such as yoga, walking, or listening to music, can help to reduce stress and anger. Additionally, it is important to recognize the power of the mind and to strive to control it. By recognizing the power of the mind and striving to control it, one can resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment. By putting forth full force of the soul in one's own soul, one can fight and vanquish doubts and foes that haunt them and would betray them. Through this, one can gain control over their anger and cultivate a more peaceful and balanced state of mind.</b>",
